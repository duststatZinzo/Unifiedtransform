In this article, we will show you how to download and install the crack file for Skylanders Spyro's Adventure PC and play the game without CD. We will also provide some tips on how to get a portal and figures if you don't have them already. Please note that this method is only for those who have legally purchased the game and want to play it on their own PC. We do not condone piracy or illegal distribution of the game.
 
## Step 1: Download the ISO file of the game
 
The first step is to download the ISO file of the game, which is an image of the original disc. You can find it on various websites, such as Archive.org[^1^] or Reddit[^2^]. Make sure you download the correct version for your region and language. The file size is about 7 GB, so it might take some time depending on your internet speed.
 
## Step 2: Mount the ISO file on a virtual drive
 
The next step is to mount the ISO file on a virtual drive, which is a software that simulates a physical CD-ROM drive on your PC. You can use any virtual drive software, such as Virtual CloneDrive[^3^], Daemon Tools, or WinCDEmu. After installing the software, you can right-click on the ISO file and select "Mount" to assign it a drive letter.
 
## Step 3: Run setup.exe and install the game
 
Once you have mounted the ISO file, you can open it in File Explorer and run setup.exe as you normally would. Follow the instructions on the screen and install the game on your desired location. You might need to enter a serial key during the installation, which you can find on your original disc case or manual.
 
## Step 4: Download and copy iphlpapi.dll to the game folder
 
After installation, you will have a new folder in your Program Files called Activision, containing the game folder. In order to play the game without CD, you need to copy a file called iphlpapi.dll to this folder. This is a generic SecuRom cracker that tricks the game into thinking that you have inserted the original disc. You can download iphlpapi.dll from various sources, such as Mega.nz or Torrentz2. You might need to set up an antivirus exception for it as some antivirus programs might flag it as malicious.
 
## Step 5: Plug in your portal and play!
 
The final step is to plug in your portal and play! You can use any portal that is compatible with PC, such as Wii, Wii U, PS3, or PS4 portals. It is only the Xbox 360 and Xbox One portals that are specific to their consoles. The Spyro's Adventure 3DS portal is universal and will work on any platform except Xbox. If you don't have a portal or figures, you can buy them online for cheap or try to emulate them with some software, but we recommend using the real ones for a better experience.
 
That's it! You can now enjoy Skylanders Spyro's Adventure on your PC without CD. Have fun!
